# Dashboard Creation from Survey Data

Objective:
The objective of this project was to create a dashboard using survey data. The survey data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query, and then visualized to gain insights into the relationship between country, job title, favorite programming language, happiness rating, and their correlation with salary and work-life balance.

Process:

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

The survey data was imported into Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
Steps such as removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and formatting data were performed to ensure data quality.
The data was split into separate columns using the split function to extract relevant information.
A custom column was created to calculate the average salary based on provided salary ranges.
Dashboard Visualization:

The cleaned data was loaded into a data visualization tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) for creating the dashboard.
Different visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, were utilized to present the survey insights effectively.
The visualizations focused on comparing variables like country, job title, favorite programming language, happiness rating, salary, and work-life balance.
Key Findings:

Country Analysis:

The dashboard revealed the distribution of survey participants across different countries.
Insights into the countries with the highest number of respondents were provided.
Job Title Analysis:

Visualizations showcased the job titles reported by the survey participants.
The most common job titles were identified, allowing for a better understanding of the survey population.
Programming Language Preference:

The dashboard depicted the preferred programming languages reported by the respondents.
It highlighted the popularity of various programming languages within the surveyed population.
Happiness Rating:

Visualizations illustrated the happiness ratings provided by the participants.
Insights into the overall happiness levels of the survey population were presented.
Salary and Work-Life Balance Analysis:

The dashboard showcased the relationship between salary, work-life balance, and happiness rating.
Insights into how salary and work-life balance influenced happiness levels were provided.
Conclusion:
By analyzing and visualizing the survey data, the dashboard provided valuable insights into the relationship between country, job title, favorite programming language, happiness rating, salary, and work-life balance. These insights can be used to understand trends, make data-driven decisions, and identify areas for improvement in various aspects related to job satisfaction and well-being.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of data visualization in gaining meaningful insights from survey data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on the findings.
